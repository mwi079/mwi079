### Welcome to my hub!ðŸ‘‹

I'm looking for something to work on which I'm passionate about. Something that excites me. I am proficient in Javascript, Typescript, React, NodeJS and MongoDB as well as familiar with many other technologies.

Before becoming a Full Stack Software Developer I worked as a Chemical Engineer on some of the world biggest energy projects. I bring from that past life the communication, problem solving and leadership skills that make me an asset to any team.  

Kindness, tolerance and laughter are important to me and I try to bring them wherever I go.
